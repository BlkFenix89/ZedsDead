My first attempt at an incremental/idle game.

Main Loop:
  Attack Zombies (Click)
  Gain Resources (Zombies Killed)
  Level Up Click 
  Recruit Survivors (Idle Unlock, current resource for purchase is Zombies Killed I'd like to change this to a seperate resource)
  Recruit More Survivors
  Build Base (Further Improve Clicks & Idle)
  
Prestige Loop:
  Tier 1 - Reset Attack;
  Tier 2 - Reset Survivors/Attack;
  Tier 3 - Reset Base/Survivors/Attack;
  
  I plan to impliment a branching path for prestiges based on upgrades made to the base itself. For example if you chose upgrades that catered specifically to
  increased damage the prestige bonus for that base would be heavily damaged focused.
    Base Focus Ideas
      Resource Gathering
      Click Damage
      Idle Damage
      Upgrade Cost
